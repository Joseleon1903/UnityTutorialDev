Unity Extension Methods

Do you ever find yourself writing a method that you feel could or should be part of an existing Unity component?
Have you ever wished the Vector3 class had a few more methods?  You should should be using extension methods!

The biggest difference between a regular method and an extension is how you call them.
Extension methods appear to be methods on an existing class (typically something thats sealed or you don’t want to inherit from).

Benefits
  * Discoverability – You can see them with Intellisense. This makes it easy to see what extra functionality you’ve provided for the classes.
  * Cleanliness – You can avoid a bunch of “SomethingHelper.cs” classes.
  * Reusability – Typically your extension methods are simple and can be re-used across all of your projects.
