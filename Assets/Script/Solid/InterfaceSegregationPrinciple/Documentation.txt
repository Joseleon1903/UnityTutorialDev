Interface Segregation Principle

In the field of software engineering, the interface-segregation principle (ISP) states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that clients will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them. 
Such shrunken interfaces are also called role interfaces.[2] ISP is intended to keep a system decoupled and thus easier to refactor, change, and redeploy. 
ISP is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design, similar to the High Cohesion Principle of GRASP.

The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states that a client should not be exposed to methods it doesn’t need. '
Declaring methods in an interface that the client doesn’t need pollutes the interface and leads to a “bulky” or “fat” interface.
